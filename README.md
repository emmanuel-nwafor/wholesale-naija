### Environment Variables
This project primarily uses client-side environment variables, which can be configured within the Next.js setup. For API interactions, ensure your backend API URL is accessible or set up in a `.env.local` file if needed for client-side fetches.

No specific environment variables are explicitly defined in the provided project files for client-side configuration. However, for potential future API calls, you might typically define:

-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for your backend API.
    *Example*: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.wholesalenaija.com`

### Running the Development Server
To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or using yarn
# yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application. The page auto-updates as you edit files.

### Building for Production
To build the application for production:
```bash
npm run build
# or using yarn
# yarn build
```
This command compiles the application for production deployment.

### Starting the Production Server
